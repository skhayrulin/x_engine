# X_ENGINE
I'm planning collect here all my work on rewrote version of engine

# Build
Just run make in root folder
	
	make

## Dependincies 
Before run you need install some libraries such as OpenCL - for work with OpenCL. For testing install gtest lib on your machine.

Than run program
	
	./bin/x_engine

# Testing

Run test just run `make` with key `test` 

	make test

It works but has only one simple google example test. For work with test you need to install google test lib.

# What I plane to include in this engine
- All code base will be based on C++11/14
- Documentation
- multi device calculation - parallel calculation will be performed on many devices (If you have 2 or more it will use all of them) 
- to be continued...
